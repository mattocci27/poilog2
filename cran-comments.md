This is a new submission of a package to calculate the probability mass function of two different types of zero-truncated Poisson lognormal distribution. 

The type 1 zero truncated Poisson lognormal distribution uses the conditional probability distribution of Poisson lognormal and the type 2 zero truncated Poisson lognormal distribution uses the zero truncated Poisson distribution. Please see vignette("ztpln") for details.

# Test environments

* ubuntu 20.4, R 4.0.2, GCC (local)
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-release, 32/64 bit (Rhub)
