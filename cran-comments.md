This is the first submission of a package to calculate the probability mass function of two different types of
zero-truncated Poisson lognormal distribution. 

The type 1 zero truncated Poisson lognormal distribution uses the conditional probability distribution of Poisson lognormal and the type 2 zero truncated Poisson lognormal distribution uses the zero truncated Poisson distribution. Please see vignette("ztpln") for details.
